# HW2 Assembly Code Analysis

#### Q2

```asm
DATA SEGMENT
X  DB  25
Y  DB  32
Z  DW  ?
DATA ENDS 

CODE SEGMENT
  ASSUME  CS:CODE,DS:DATA
START:
  MOV AX,DATA
  MOV DS,AX
  MOV AL,X
  MUL AL
  MOV BX,0
  MOV BL,Y
  ADD BL,BL
  ADC BH,0
  ADD BL,Y
  ADC BH,0
  SUB AX,BX
  SHR AX,1
  MOV Z,AX
  MOV AH,4CH
  INT 21H
CODE ENDS
  END START
```

This code seems to just perform some simple arithemtic. The program exits on the last two lines, which causes a system interrupt with the return code contained in AH.

```asm
DATA SEGMENT
X  DB  25
Y  DB  32
Z  DW  ?
DATA ENDS 
```
This code creates a few variables of size byte and assigns values to them. Z, however, is not initialized with a value. Since the values of the individual nibbles matters here, I will track them:

```
X = 00100000
Y = 00011001
```

```asm
MOV AX,DATA
```
This moves the data variables into the accumulator. Since, only X and Y have values and are 8 bytes long each, they will fit the 16 byte size of AX.
```
AX = 0010000000011001
```

```asm
MOV DS,AX
```
This moves the contents of AX into the Data Segment (DS) register, which will hold the address of the contents of AX. 

```asm
MOV AL,X
```
This moves the contents of X into the lower half of the 8bit accumulator. However, the lower nibble of X is equal to 0. 

```asm
MUL AL
```
Multiply the contents of AX by AL.  Since AL is 0, AX now eqauls 0.

```asm
MOV BX,0
```
Zeroes out the contents of the base register, which is used for memory access.

```asm
MOV BL,Y
```
Moves the contents of Y into the lower nibble of the base register. 

```asm
ADD BL,BL
```
Adds the contents of BL to itself. In this case, the operation is:
```
  1001
+ 1001
  0010
```
Since ADC is not used, the overflow of the largest bit discard. 

```asm
ADC BH,0
```
This code will not do anything. It adds 0 to BH. The carry flag is not used.

```
ADD BL,Y
```
This will add the contents of Y to BL.
```
      0010
+ 00011001
      1011
```
The upper half is not considered, since BL is used.

```asm
ADC BH,0
```
This code will not do anything. It adds 0 to BH. The carry flag is not used.

```asm
SUB AX,BX
```

```
  00000000
- 00001011
OR
  00000000
+ 11110101

AX = 11110101 (-11)
```

```asm
SHR AX,1
```
This shifts the binary contents of the register to the right once. 

```
11110101 -> 01111010 (122)
```

```asm
mov Z,AX
```
This sets the value of Z to be the contents of the accumulator, or 122 in decimal.

```asm
MOV AH,4CH
INT 21H
```
Now, the program exits with return code 122. 

#### Q3

```asm
.data
array dd 34,12,3,18
szMsg db "%d",0ah,0

.code
start:
    move   ecx,3

L2:
    push   ecx
    xor    esi,esi
    mov    ecx,3

L0:
    mov    ebx,array[esi]
    cmp    ebx,array[esi+4]
    jb     L1
    xchg   ebx,array[esi+4]
    mov    array[esi],ebx
    add    esi,4

L1:
    loop   L0
    pop    ecx
    loop   L2
    xor    esi,esi
    mov    ecx,4

L3:
    push   ecx
    invoke printf,offset szMsg,array[esi]
    add esi,4
    pop ecx
    loop L3
    ret

end start
```

This code performs some kind of sort. I'm guessing it's it's InsertionSort, because the `cmp ebx,array[esi+4]` looks like a comparison of the indices. 


```asm
array dd 34,12,3,18
szMsg db "%d",0ah,0
```

This section setups some variables for the sort. For example, the array is initialized with the values 34,12,3, and 18.
